A) 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 45
B) 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 36
C) 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 28
D) 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 21
E) 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 15
F) 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10
G) 3 + 2 + 1 = 6
H) 2 + 1 = 3
I) 1

The question is to find the largest pandigital prime number.
A pandigital number is an n-digit number that makes use of
all digits 1 to n exactly once.

The above cases of A, B, D, E, G, and H are divisible by 3. 
Example: the sum of the numbers 9 through 1 is 45 - which is
divisible by 3, so a pandigital number with 9 digits can NOT
be a prime numnber.

This means that the answer will fall into case I, F or C.

First, we identify all prime numbers less than 10^8. Next, 
we work downwards from the largst prime number checking to
see if the prime number is pandigital. The code stops when
the first prime is found to be pandigital.
